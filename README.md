If you want to use TriageSQL in your work, please cite as follows:
```
@article{zhang2020did,
  title={Did You Ask a Good Question? A Cross-Domain Question Intention Classification Benchmark for Text-to-SQL},
  author={Zhang, Yusen and Dong, Xiangyu and Chang, Shuaichen and Yu, Tao and Shi, Peng and Zhang, Rui},

Also, the correct citation of the paper, 'Iterative feature mining for constraint-based data collection to increase data diversity and model robustness' in our paper should be:
```
@InProceedings{emnlp20taboo,
  title     = {Iterative Feature Mining for Constraint-Based Data Collection to Increase Data Diversity and Model Robustness},
  author    = {Larson, Stefan and Zheng, Anthony and Mahendran, Anish and Tekriwal, Rishi and Cheung, Adrian and Guldan, Eric and Leach, Kevin and Kummerfeld, Jonathan K.},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing},
  month     = {November},
  year      = {2020},

```
Please note that this is **not** the bibtex of our paper.
