Also, the correct citation of the paper, 'Iterative feature mining for constraint-based data collection to increase data diversity and model robustness' in our paper should be:
```
@InProceedings{emnlp20taboo,
  title     = {Iterative Feature Mining for Constraint-Based Data Collection to Increase Data Diversity and Model Robustness},
  author    = {Larson, Stefan and Zheng, Anthony and Mahendran, Anish and Tekriwal, Rishi and Cheung, Adrian and Guldan, Eric and Leach, Kevin and Kummerfeld, Jonathan K.},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing},
  month     = {November},
  year      = {2020},
  location  = {Online},
}
```
Please note that this is **not** the bibtex of our paper.
